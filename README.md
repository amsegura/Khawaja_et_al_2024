# Chaperone Mediated Autophagy activity atlas along aging

This project represent the first characterization of CMA activity along aging in different tissues, accounting for cell type variability and specificity. The CMA aging atlas is comprised by scRNA and inmunofluorescence data. Find the whole manustript here. The scRNA data was obtained upon analysis of the well documented repository on aging at the sigle cell level known as [Tabula muris](https://github.com/czbiohub/tabula-muris).
